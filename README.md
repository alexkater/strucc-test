# **Welcome to Strucc Test App** ![PR](https://github.com/alexkater/strucc-test/workflows/PR/badge.svg)

## What is this project for?
To show how to create a camera + video editor simply

## What have I used for this?
Just native <UIKit, Combine, AVFoundation, CoreImage, CIFilter>

## How it works?
Just run the app, record two videos, and you can see the final composition. Take note that the composition will take the sortest video lenght.

## What's next?
I will add the export composition and more cool filters

## How it looks? like this!

## What about testing?
I added a bunch of unit tests where I consider is important and feasible to test, as viewModels and services.
